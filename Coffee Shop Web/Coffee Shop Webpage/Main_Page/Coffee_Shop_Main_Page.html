                <h4>5 HEALTH BENEFITS OF COFFEE</h4>
                 
                  <ol>
                    <li>Coffee boosts your physical performance. </li>
                    <p>Have a cup of black coffee about an hour before workout and your performance can improve by 11-12%. Caffeine increases adrenaline levels in your blood. Adrenaline is your body’s “fight or flight” hormone which helps you to prepare for physical exertion.</p>
                    <li>Coffee may help you lose weight.</li>
                    <p>Coffee contains magnesium and potassium, which helps the human body use insulin, regulating blood sugar levels and reducing your craving for sugary treats and snacks. </p>
                    <li>Coffee helps you burn fat. </li>
                    <p>Caffeine helps fat cells break down body fat and use it as fuel for training.</p>
                    <li>Coffee helps you focus and stay alert. </li>
                    <p>Moderate caffeine intake, 1-6 cups a day, helps you focus and improves your mental alertness.</p>
                    <li>Coffee lowers risk of death.</li>
                    <p>Studies have shown that coffee drinker’s overall risk of premature death is 25% lower than of those who don’t drink coffee.</p>
                  </ol>
